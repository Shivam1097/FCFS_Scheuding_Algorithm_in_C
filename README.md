# FCFS_Scheuding_Algorithm_in_C
This is a First Come First Serve(FCFS) Program In C.

It calculate the Waiting Time(WT) for each process And Average Waiting Time(AWT) for all processes.

It also calculate the Turn Around Time Time(TAT) for each process And Average Turn Around Time Time(ATAT) for all processes.

User can manually enter -- 

1.) No. of processes.
2.) Burst Time of each process.
3.) Arrival Time of each process.
